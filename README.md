## Overview

FileShare is a secure, end-to-end encrypted file-sharing platform with both a Qt desktop client and a JavaScript web client. It emphasises confidentiality, integrity and authenticity, even if the server or network is compromised.



## Architecture & Modules

- **Backend Server**  
  - Exposes a RESTful API for authentication, file management and sharing.  
  - Implemented in REACT typescript.

- **Qt Client (C++)**  
  - Native desktop application.  
  - Demonstrates modern C++ features (OOP, templates, smart pointers, etc.)

- **Web Client (JavaScript)**  
  - Browser-based SPA.  
  - Uses Web Crypto API and up-to-date security headers.
